The problem we had Clojush try to solve came from "www.codingbat.com/prob/p191363":

Given a certain number of 5kg and 1kg chocolate bars, return the minimum amount of 1kg bars needed to fill an order of X kg of chocolate. If there are not enough bars, return -1.

The problem was setup to receive a 3-integer array 
[1kg bars , 5kg bars , target kg's]
and return either a -1 or the amount of 1kg bars.

The program did end up reaching a solution. 

The solution was only reached after increasing the the population-size and max-evaluations to exorbant sizes.
